## Welcome to My 'Currency Converter App':
This App is made using python tkinter and in the background an API is used.  
We can convert any currency type to any other currency type using this APP.

---
### Basic View:
The App looks like this:

![Basic View](https://github.com/debroglie27/CurrencyConverterApp/blob/b8568d83cb3f40e472f6acccf3f6037130e5ad5b/Images/Basic_View.png)

Here we can provide the name of the *Base Country* whose currency we would like to convert.  
Next we can provide the name of the *Conversion Country* whose currency we want to convert to.

Then by clicking on the *Conversion Rate Button* we can find the conversion rate   
between those countries.

---
### Example:
This is how to use the App.

![Conversion Rate](https://github.com/debroglie27/CurrencyConverterApp/blob/cb17aeb2d95bb610db85938ef20efca29c4df158/Images/Conversion_Rate.png)

Here the *Unlock Button* is used because after clicking on the   
*Conversion Rate Button* every Entry Box becomes *readonly*.   
Therefore, *Unlock Button* is used to make the Entry Boxes editable again.

---
### Now the Actual Conversion Part:
This is how the Convert Window looks.
> Note: We cannot go to the *Convert Window* without specifying the *Base Country*  
and *Conversion Country*.

![Convert](https://github.com/debroglie27/CurrencyConverterApp/blob/f302373fa174cdc80a7d28eb959d5807f3f54145/Images/Convert.png)

As shown above we can provide the currency amount for the *Base Country*  
and clicking on the *Convert Button* converts that amount to its equivalent  
*Conversion Country* currency value.

Finally, the *Clear Button* is used to clear the Entry Boxes.

### THE END
Thank You for going through my *Currency Converter App*.
